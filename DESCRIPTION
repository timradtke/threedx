Title: Three-Dimensional Exponential Smoothing Forecasts

Description: Use 3DX to generate interpretable probabilistic forecasts by purely
    weighting values from the observed time series. Unique about 3DX is that it
    can be used to derive forecasts not only based on a “latent state” but also
    observation-driven, drawing future realizations purely from observed values.
    This can be effective for count or intermittent series. The 3DX sampling
    distribution is a combination of three components: The first weighs
    observations exponentially, the second weighs observations within each
    seasonal period exponentially, the third weighs the seasonal periods over
    time exponentially.
